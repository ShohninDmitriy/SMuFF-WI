# SMuFF-WebInterface

Keep in mind this is a browser app based on the Web Serial API which runs locally in your browser and connects to the SMuFF via a serial interface. Thus, your SMuFF has to be connected to your PC either via a local COM port or via Bluetooth.
So far, I can confirm it runs in either **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge** browser flawlessly. **Opera** does show the devices available but doesn't show me the "Connect" button. **Firefox** seems **not** to support the Web Serial API.
